## Gapminder Data

Before getting into the Gapminders data, we need to install/load a few packages. To see what packages we already have installed, we can simply use the command `rownames(installed.packages())`. If a package that we need isn't available, we use the command `install.packages(<PACKAGE NAME>)`. To load the library, we use `library(<PACKAGE NAME>)`. 

Another way to go about this is to first define our needed packages as strings in an array (`c()` in R) and then loop through them checking to see if they exist, and if not, installing them and then ultimately loading them. The following block of code does this on the array defined as `pack`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Set packages we want to use
pack<-c(
  "dslabs",
  "tidyverse",
  "data.table",
  "shiny"
) 

# If packages exist then load them, otherwise install them first
for(i in 1:length(pack)){
  if(pack[i] %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {
    install.packages(pack[i])
  }
}
for(i in 1:length(pack)){
  lapply(pack[i], require, character.only = TRUE)
}
```

```{r eval=TRUE, include = FALSE}
# Set packages we want to use
pack<-c(
  "dslabs",
  "tidyverse",
  "data.table",
  "shiny"
) 

# If packages exist then load them, otherwise install them first
for(i in 1:length(pack)){
  if(pack[i] %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {
    install.packages(pack[i])
  }
}
for(i in 1:length(pack)){
  lapply(pack[i], require, character.only = TRUE)
}
```

### Gapminder data
The Gapminder data is one of many datasets that are available in the `dslabs` package. Gapminder is an organization that collects and analyzes world data: <https://www.gapminder.org/>. The late Hans Rosling gave an incredible TED Talk on the data we will be playing with that really portrays how the health of our world has increased through time. It can be seen here: <https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en>

We can create a <i>data frame</i> object in R named `data` through specifying we want the `gapminder` data out of the `dslabs` package.

```{r eval=TRUE}
data<-dslabs::gapminder
```

We can see what variables are included in the data by using the `head` function:

```{r eval=TRUE}
head(data)
```

We can see that we have infant mortality, life expectancy, fertility, population, gdp, continent, and region all by year for each country. We can also summarize the data with `summary()`:

```{r eval = TRUE}
summary(data)
```

### dplyr and ggplot2

The `dplyr` package is a great data-structuring package that can be used to perform SQL-like queries on an R data frame. The scope of this tutorial is not to show `dplyr` actions, but as a quick definition, here are some useful verbs:
<ul>
<li>`select()`: select columns</li>
<li>`filter()`: create filters on selected columns</li>
<li>`arrange()`: order selected columns</li>
<li>`mutate()`: create columns or transform existing columns</li>
</ul>

There are more, but the above are some of the most widely used. Another important concept from `dplyr` is the pipe operator `%>%`. This operator allows you to do actions on the data in a sequential fashion, where each action occurs in order based on the order of the pipe operators.

For example, we can visualize the data for the year 2000 on the relationship between infant mortality and fertility rate (children per women) by taking the data frame object, piping into the `filter()` command and then piping into the `ggplot()` function. The `aes()` command represents an <i>aesthetic</i> wrapper that specifies the variables from the data frame object that we want to visualize. To see all argument options and geometric capabilities, see <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/>.

```{r eval=TRUE}
data %>% filter(year == 2000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = infant_mortality, y = fertility, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(size = 3)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,225))+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1,9.5))+
  ylab("Children per Women")+
  xlab("Infant Mortality")
```

You might have noticed that there are a few variable components from the code that produced the above plot. The `year`, `x`, `y`, and `color` arguments are all variable. Let's focus solely on the `year` variable. Suppose we wanted to see the relationship between the `fertility` column and the `life_expectancy` column through time. Accomplishing this can be easy nwo that we have determined the only item that is variable is the time.

So, we can create a function that takes `year` as an argument and plots our columns of interest against eachother for the year specified. Let's call it `gapPlot()`:

```{r eval = TRUE}
gapPlot<-function(Year){
  # Adding in mean lines
  meanCalc<-function(Year){mean(data$life_expectancy[data$year == Year])}
  
  data %>% filter(year == Year) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = life_expectancy, y = fertility, color = continent)) +
    geom_point(size = 3)+
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(25,84))+
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1,9.5))+
    ylab("Children per Women")+
    xlab("Life Expectancy")+
    geom_vline(xintercept = meanCalc(Year), lty = 2, color = "darkblue")
}
```

Testing it out we can that the plots change according to the specified year:

```{r eval=TRUE}
gapPlot(1960)
gapPlot(1990)
gapPlot(2015)
```

So the next question becomes <b>how do we visualize this relationship through time?</b> Well, we could simply plot each year between 1960 and 2015 next to eachother, but that would be an eyesore. A better way to do this is to create a `shiny` app.


### Shiny Apps
Creating a web app with `shiny` can be very easy and straightforward. At the simplest level, `shinyApp()` function from the `shiny` package takes 2 arguments:
<ol>
<li>ui: The user interface can easily leverage the `fluidPage` function to create the look and feel of the web page.</li>
<li>server: The server is simply a function of inputs and outputs that displays the data elements. In our case, they are generating graphics from the `gapPlot` function we defined previously.</li>
</ol>

```{r eval = TRUE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # Creating a formula for the text that will appear on screen
  formulaText <- reactive({
    paste("Fertility vs. Life Expectancy for ", input$variable, sep = "")
  })
  
  # Return the formula text for printing as a caption 
  output$caption <- renderText({
    formulaText()
  })
  
  # Generate a plot of the requested year
  output$PlotA <- renderPlot({
    gapPlot(input$variable)
  })
}

ui <- fluidPage(
  # App title
  titlePanel("Gapminder Data App"),
  
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions 
  sidebarLayout(
    
    # Sidebar panel for inputs
    sidebarPanel(
      # Input: Slide bar for year
      sliderInput("variable", 
                  "Year:", 
                  min = 1960, 
                  max = 2015, 
                  value = 1,
                  step = 1,
                  animate = animationOptions(interval = 900, loop = FALSE),
                  sep = "")
      
    ),
    
    # Main panel for displaying outputs
    mainPanel(
      
      # Output: Formatted text for caption
      h3(textOutput("caption")),
      
      # Output: Plot of the fertility vs. life expectancy
      plotOutput("PlotA")
    )
  )
)
```


Again, executing the shiny app we just built can be done with the `shinyApp()` function.


```{r eval=FALSE}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Unfortunately, Shiny applications are not supported in static R Markdown documents, and so thus we cannot play with the final product without actually running the code. If you are following along, you will be able to see the below. Clicking the play button will show you the relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy by country through time.
